# Here's a step-by-step guide including all the commands used for installing Jitsi Meet on a server:

Step 1: Install Docker and Docker Compose:

1-Install Docker:

sudo apt update

sudo apt install docker.io

2-Install Docker Compose:

sudo apt install docker-compose

Step 2: Clone Jitsi Meet Docker Repository:

1-Clone the Jitsi Meet Docker repository:

git clone https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet.git ~/jitsi-meet

Step 3: Configure Jitsi Meet:

1-Navigate to the Jitsi Meet Docker directory:

cd ~/jitsi-meet/docker-jitsi-meet

2-Modify the .env file to set configuration options such as PUBLIC_URL, HTTP_PORT, HTTPS_PORT, and others as per your requirements.

Step 4: Start Jitsi Meet Containers:

1-Start the Jitsi Meet containers:

docker-compose up -d

Step 5: Verify Installation:

1-Check the status of running containers:

docker ps

Step 6: Access Jitsi Meet:

1-Access Jitsi Meet using your server's IP address and configured port (e.g., http://<server_ip>:<HTTP_PORT>).


Step 7: Optional Steps:

1-Optionally, you can configure firewall settings to allow traffic on the specified ports (e.g., HTTP_PORT, HTTPS_PORT) if necessary.


Step 8: Additional Configuration (Optional)

1-You can further configure Jitsi Meet according to your requirements by modifying the respective configuration files in the ~/jitsi-meet/docker-jitsi-meet directory.

### update:

Step 1: Install Docker and Docker Compose
For Linux:

Copy code
# Install Docker

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Install Docker Compose

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


Step 2: Prepare Jitsi Meet Docker Setup

Copy code

# Clone the Jitsi Meet Docker Repository

git clone https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet.git

cd docker-jitsi-meet

# Create a .env File

cp env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with a text editor

# Adjust variables like CONFIG, HTTP_PORT, and HTTPS_PORT as needed

nano .env     # or use your preferred text editor. In the .env file, make sure to adjust variables like CONFIG, HTTP_PORT, 

and HTTPS_PORT according to your setup. Since you don't have SSL configured, you may set HTTP_PORT to 80 and HTTPS_PORT to 

an empty string.


Step 3: Run Jitsi Meet with Docker Compose

Copy code

# Generate Configuration Files

./gen-passwords.sh

# Start Jitsi Meet

docker-compose up -d

Accessing Your Jitsi Meet Instance

To access your Jitsi Meet instance, open a web browser and go to http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000 (replace YOUR_SERVER_IP with the actual IP address of your server).


Step 4: Stopping and Cleaning Up

Copy code

# Stop Jitsi Meet

docker-compose down

# Clean Up (Optional)

# If you want to completely remove Jitsi Meet Docker containers and data

# Ensure you also delete the CONFIG directory specified in your .env file

These commands should help you install Jitsi Meet on your server using Docker and Docker Compose. Remember to replace 
YOUR_SERVER_IP with the actual IP address of your server when accessing the Jitsi Meet instance in your browser
